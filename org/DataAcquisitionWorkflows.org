- For purpose
  - For types of data generators
  - For applicable transformations 
  - By source
  - By properties
    - Quality
    - Missing data
  - Distributions
- Ranomly generated
  - Properties
  - Variable relationships
** Data manipulation
- Specifications
- Transformations
  - Re-shaping
  - Combining
  - Grouping
  - Filtering
- Quality verification
  - Pre-manipulation
  - Post-manipulation
** Final form
- Target consumer
- Target repository
- Target organization / format
- Relational database
  - XML
  - JSON
  - CSV
  - Etc.
** Documentation
- Generated
- Manually written
** Unit tests
- Social contract with target consumer

* TODO Sample dialogs [0%] [0/4]
1. [ ] Random tabular data 
   - Create a random dataset with five columns and 2000 rows
   - At least two of the columns are categorical
   - Sprinkle 200 NAs
2. [ ] Random tabular data
   - Make a dataset with 200 numerical columns and 1000 rows
   - Each column is with Normal or Poisson distribution
   - The Normal distributions have means from -10 to 100
   - And standard deviations from 10% to 200%
   - Make there are at least 20 column pairs that correlate
3. [ ] Fuel pumps data
   - Take time series data for company's fuel pumps
   - Transform the data into star schema
   - Make a separate table for the variables
   - Make a separate table for the events
   - Make a separate table for the pumps
   - Show tables summaries
4. [ ] Netflix Prize data
   - Get the data for Netlix Prize
   - Transform the long form into a contingency matrix
   - Remove the empty rows and columns
   - Remove rows and columns with less than 5 elements
   - Convert the matrix into long form
   - Get metadata for each movie in a separate table
   - Make the metadata table in long form
* TODO Implementation [0%] [0/3]
